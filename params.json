{"name":"Coolpiano","tagline":"I created this project to learn how to use the different components NIOS II has. I used a DE2 115 board and this code can be improve for sure but I don't think I'm going to spend more time with it, if you like assembly code have fun reading","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThanks to GitHub Pages Generator I edited this page to show you reader how this code works.\r\n\r\n### Explaining the code\r\nThe Java File was created following these steps:\r\nI need to get 24000 samples of every musical note to can play it on the NIOS II processor on DE2 115 board.\r\nFirst at all I search for the frequencies in 4thoctave at this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies\r\nI wrote in an array of datatype double the frequences from C4 to B4, after that I learned some wave physics to obtain every sample from 0 to 23999, A*sin(2*PI*TIME*frequency) where frequency has the same value for every single note and TIME is the value is changing through the loop. Then I created a file and wrote the notes on it.\r\n\r\nMain Program initialices the interruption from buttons and keys, reads a String from memory and writes it on the JTAG UART port, after that does nothing.\r\n\r\nHANDLEREXCEPTION:\r\nDetects the begining of the interruption and fix it using one routine or the other one, if a button was pressed, plays a song showing in the displays Playing this song: \"name of the song\". The displays are 7segment displays and are located at 0x10000020 and 0x10000030. Audio Port is located at 0x10003040 and JTAG UART Port is located at 0x10001000.\r\nAnd that's all I think, remember to enable interruption and set to 0 the bit that represents an interruption was launched and if you have doubts about it, ask me.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI have to say I wrote every single lane of code, but University prefer to give a same mark to everybody, I have no reason or motivation to study just for pass any subject, I am here learning to understand the world, \"our world fill with 1's and 0's\",\r\naround us. So I am Mario Alberto Segura Oliva, born in 1993 in Canary Islands(Spain). If you love practice sports, developing some code or just play or listen music nice to meet you ;D.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you are interested in obtain more information about this project or other one, dont doubt and contact me at marioalbertoseguraoliva@gmail.com I swear to answer asap.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
